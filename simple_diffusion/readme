This example correspond to the simplest 2D diffusion problem: a rectangular system with a fixed constant concentration on top and zero concentration (adsorbing boundary) at the bottom.
Initially the fluid is empty of solute.

We observe (correctly) the formation of a concentration gradient but the fluxes calculated by ELmer (.dat) do not correspond to theory.

BRIEF DICUSSION OF PROBLEMS:

1) Incorrect total mass
The fixed top 2D concentration is 0.1kg/m2 and at bottom we have an adsorbing boundary with fixed 0 concentration. The separation between them is 1 cm.
In the steady state theory predicts a linear profiel with an average concentration of 0.05kg/m2 and total mass (integrating the profile) of 2.5e-8kg
This value is two orders of magntgidue smaller than the value given by ELMER (see .dat file)

2) Incorrect diffusive flux
Using fick's law and the diffusion coefficient used in the .sif we get a flux of 5e-11kg/s in the steady state which differs to the value given by ELMER 
(see .dat file).

3) Convective flux 0
There is no convection and velocity is fixed to 0 (NS equations are not solved and convection not considered)
ELMER gives in the .dat file a convective flux of 4 orders of magntiude larger than the diffusive flux
